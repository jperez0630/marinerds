title: Who has the best 4-Seam Fastball?
---

Ah, the 4-Seam Fastball.  Also known as the 4-Seamer and the Rising Fastball.  It is named thus based on how the ball is gripped by a pitcher and due to the fact that the batter sees 4 seams as the ball spins toward the plate. It is an essential part of a pitcher’s arsenal and having a good one can be the difference between spending most of your MLB career traveling on a chartered plane as opposed to a chartered bus.
