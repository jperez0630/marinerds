## Recap<br><br>

### Starter<br>
Kirby vacuumed up the Royals today—I got a million of ‘em, don’t worry—giving up just 1 ER on 5 hits and no walks in 7 innings.  Definition of a Quality Start, which was sorely needed. He mixed his pitches pretty well going mostly Slider, Sinker, 4-Seamer.  Speaking of his slider, it was biting like Charlie “Bit My Finger”, diving down-and-in to right-handed batters.  He stayed away from the heart of the plate for the most part and his propensity to keep it low in the zone led to a plethora of weak ground balls, which would be a terrible name for a meatball recipe. Kudos to Kirby.

### Bullpen<br>
The bullpen, again, was not the bastion that we’ve come to expect, conspiring with the defense to give up 4 runs.  The long ball was the primary nemesis today. Way too many hard-hit balls for comfort.  They did manage to prevent any walks, which was probably the difference between winning and losing.
